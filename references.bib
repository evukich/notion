  abstract = "In the current study, we aimed to explore the lived experience of
              Israeli parents who engaged in musical dialogues with their
              preterm infants during music therapy (MT) after being discharged
              from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), as a part of the
              multinational LongSTEP RCT. Seven participants of the main trial
              were invited to engage in semi-structured in-depth interviews
              intertwining listening to audio recordings from their music
              therapy sessions in an adapted interpersonal process recall (IPR)
              procedure. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using
              interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). We understood the
              participants' experiences to reflect two main themes: 1) Music
              therapy as a potential means of transformation in communication
              skills, resourcefulness and sense of agency; and 2) emotional and
              musical preconditions for parental engagement in MT. The findings
              illustrate how a specific group of Israeli parents experienced MT
              as offering them a means of expanding their relationship with
              their preterm infants after discharge. Based on our findings, we
              recommend that music therapists consider parents' musical and
              emotional resources during post-discharge MT to meet the
              individual needs of families.",
